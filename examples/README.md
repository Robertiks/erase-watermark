# DeWatermark Examples

This directory contains example scripts that demonstrate how to use the DeWatermark library in both Python and TypeScript.

## Python Example

The `python_example.py` file shows how to:

- Initialize the DeWatermark class
- Load an image from a file
- Process the image to remove watermarks
- Save the processed image
- Display before/after comparison (if in an interactive environment)

To run the example:

```bash
python python_example.py
```

Make sure to place an image named `input_image.jpg` in the same directory or update the path in the script.

## TypeScript Example

The `typescript_example.ts` file shows how to:

- Initialize the DeWatermark class
- Load an image from a file
- Process the image to remove watermarks
- Save the processed image

To run the example:

```bash
# Using Bun
bun typescript_example.ts

# Using Node.js with ts-node
ts-node typescript_example.ts
```

Make sure to place an image named `input_image.jpg` in the same directory or update the path in the script.
